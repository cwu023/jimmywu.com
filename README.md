"jimmywu.com" is my portfolio website for showcasing all my works in front-end web developement. For this project I decided to incorporate Bootstrap 4 to build my portfolio website. I love using Bootstrap because it makes your site responsive with little code and it is well documented as well. As such an amazing and popular framework, I feel it is important to know how to use it in a project.

Technologies used:

HTML5

CSS3

Bootstrap4

JavaScript

AJAX
